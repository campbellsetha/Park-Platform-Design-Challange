# Park-Platform-Design-Challange
TCSS 496 - Park Platform Design Activity for "The Visionaries"
Group Members: Alexander Pham, Alexander Petrik, Seth Campbell, Kobe Benavente


Why the selected task was important for the platform.

  We decided that a GPS oriented, filter search should be a primary feature in designing this app given the need for the app stemed from finding local parks in a community. This alone wouldn't make the app as useful as it could be and the "favorites" and "report issues" feature were added to connect users to their community.

How your design reflects the feedback from your peers.

  Our first iteration was a light on features for the mobile app and alot of the functionality was pushed to the website. During our rework, we moved some features, specifically "issue notification" and "favorites" to the mobile app. We did recieved alot of positive feedback about the simplicity and ease of use for with our app, specifically the use of Icons to minimize clutter. This feedback was used to drive our redesign for the prototype.
